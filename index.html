        <p>


            The <span>Beagle</span> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound.
            The beagle
            was developed
            primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking
            instincts, the
            <span>Beagle</span> is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and
            foodstuffs in
            quarantine
            around the world. The <span>Beagle</span> is intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper,
            and a lack of
            inherited
            health problems.
